I am a third year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, where I am co-advised by [Franziska Roesner](https://www.franziroesner.com/) and [Tadayoshi Kohno](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/). My research interests lie in web measurement, and making the internet a more transparent, safe place. My work broadly focuses on consumer protection, and improving people's security and privacy through developing stronger policies or building stronger systems.
